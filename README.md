# TNE090_Project
OFDMA in python code
This is a project in the course TNE090 Wireless Sensor Networks.
The scope of the project was to learn python and simultaneously, for our own purpose, learn github and more specifically github for windows. 
Me and my partner have chosen to try and create and OFDMA filter with QAM modulation.
